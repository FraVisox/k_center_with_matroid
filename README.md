# k_center_with_matroid
The following project is the bachelor thesis of Francesco Visona'.

## What is it
The problem addressed is the Fair K-Center Clustering, a problem of K-Center Clustering where the set of centers calculated by the algorithm should 
be an independent set for a given partition matroid. The theory behind this project, and the results of the successive analysis can be found
